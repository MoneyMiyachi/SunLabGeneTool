### Overview:
<br/>
This Tool is designed to offer correlation insight between the set of known CRISPR5 publications and your own CRISPR5 experimental results. The database of differential gene expressions used to offer insight on gene correlation was gathered from multiple published journals analyzing differential gene expression between a control and overexpression or underexpression sample of a specific gene.

### Directions:

1. Select the type of input and either upload a file or copy and paste deliminated results with the first column header labeled Gene and the second column header labeled with the name of the experimental gene.

2. To check the input press the Load Input File or Load Text Input buttons below each of respective input fields. **The input must have header titles: Gene, [Name of Over/Under Expresed Gene]**

3. To analyze the correlation of your sample data compared to our database, Press the Correlation Analysis button under the data field that
you like to be analyzed be displayed in the Rankings and Plot Tabs on the right of the page.

4. An example file, and example text input have been provided to guide users on the input The HKGP-DB Tool properly accepts.
