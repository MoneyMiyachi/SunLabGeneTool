### Overview:
<br/>
The Human Keratinocyte Gene Perturbation Database Tool was designed to be used by medical professionals and researchers. The tool is intended to offer correlation insight into new single gene overexpression or knockdown epidermal experiments. 

### Directions:

1. Select the type of input you will enter. Either File Upload or Text Input.

2. Upload a CSV file or Copy & Paste deliminated text that are the results of your own experiment. 
**The input must have header titles: Gene, [Name of Experimental Gene]**

3. Press the "Load" button to review the data table that was read as input. To analyze the correlation of your data compared to our database, Press the Correlation Analysis button. The the output of the Correlation Analysis can be viewed on tabs "Pearson Correlation Rankings" and "Correlation Bar Plot". 

4. Download and example input file, or render an example text entry with the "Example File/Input" Button. Clear all I/O with the "Clear Input/Output" Button in red.
